            </div>

        <div class="About-conteent">
            <p>The name of our founder<b> Janab Thangal Kunju Musaliar</b> is written in golden letters in the annals of
                the history of our country. Our founder has the rare privilege of being honoured by the Union Government
                with postal stamps and first day covers. Janab Musaliar was much more than the founder of an educational
                institution. Born in a middle-class family in Kollam on 12th January 1897, he had the unique distinction
                of being one of the world’s biggest employers. His family proudly traces their ancestry to Malik ibn
                Dinar, a legendary Islamic missionary who came to India in the 8th century.</p><br>
            <p>Janab Thangal Kunju Musaliar’s name conjures up memories of an era when Kollam dominated the cashew
                export trade in the 1940s and 50s. He was the pioneer of the cashew industry in Kerala and through his
                meticulous vision and impeccable planning, he built up a vast business empire. He played a pivotal role
                in contributing the much-needed foreign exchange to the state. He founded social and philanthropic
                organizations, wrote books and started a newspaper. During the Second World War, when food became
                scarce, he used his personal resources to carry out large scale agriculture. In the 1950s, while at the
                pinnacle of his business career, Janab Musaliar became preoccupied with thoughts of how best he could
                provide education to the new generation for the better development of the society. As a man of
                remarkable vision, he foresaw the tremendous importance of education in the years to come and this
                culminated in the formation of TKM Educational Trust in 1956. The first institution of the Trust was the
                very first engineering college in the private sector in Kerala. Less than a decade after founding the
                engineering college, feeling the need for an Arts and Science College, Janab Musaliar oversaw the
                establishment of T.K.M. College of Arts and Science, one year before his unexpected demise. Though
                robbed of the Founder’s personal guidance and patronage, the college, under the able administration and
                intendance of his eldest son Janab. Shahal Hassan Musaliar, soon grew in stature scripting its own saga
                of excellence.</p><br>
            <p>The life of Janab Musaliar exemplifies greatness in its true sense. Several of his initiatives and
                achievements in trade, industry and education have assumed astounding and prophetic significance in the
                changing national and global scenario. In recognition of his invaluable contributions to the nation, the
                Government of India released a commemorative postage stamp in his name.</p><br>
            <p>Today, as the academic opulence of T.K.M. educational institutions continue, we see the unmatched success
                of a visionary statesman and multifaceted personality, late Janab Thangal Kunju Musaliar, who fulfilled
                his noble dream of empowering the society through education.</p><br>
